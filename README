re•sur•rec•tion |ˌrezəˈrekSHən| noun
the action or fact of resurrecting or being resurrected:

This is a bunch of code I began writing at the beginning of the year. My thinking at the time was
that I would be able to use this code layer to write better scripts, and learn something about
Apple's System Configuration Framework at the same time. I have just never found the time to 
complete it.

I think there are some very definite faults with the design, and I would welcome any suggestions
as to how to improve it.
